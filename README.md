# Finite Element Solver for Parabolic Equations
This code provides a simple, pedagogical implementation of the finite element method for parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs).

### FEniCS
This code is designed to illustrate a collection of fundamental methods/techniques for solving PDEs using the finite element method.  It is recommended that a more high-performance computing platform such as (FEniCS)[https://fenicsproject.org/] is used for real applications of the finite element method.  Setting up and solving partial differential equations in FEniCS is extremely straight-forward and much more numerically stable than the more pedagogical code provided in this repository.
